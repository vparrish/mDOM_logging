# mDOM Logging
A small repo to help organize and streamline mDOM production organization.

In here you'll find python scripts!
One will make a big spreadsheet of links that you can then bulk QR code. 
Another one will format the wiki page. 
You'll find the current productions of the qr code csv file and the wiki page text file here too. 

There's also a script that converts the links into qr codes, and saves them to a file. That's all included too. 

Yay
